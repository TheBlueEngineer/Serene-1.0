### Description of the project
Serene is a web based application that implements a machine learning model meant to detect depressive or non-depressive tendencies in the user's texts. This is a project that I intend to further develop and transform it into a reliable tool for people.

### Initial project ideas
- Scrap data from Reddit. 
- Preprocess the data.
- Build NLP models for text classification.

### Accomplishments 
- Scrap data from Reddit's subreddits with Pushshift.io API.
- Preprocess the textual data.
- Build the machine learning models, using Scikit-learn and Keras with Tensorflow.
- Develop a deeper knowledge of Logistic Regression, SGDClassifiers, Word-level CNNs, Character-level CNNs and the optimization of deep neural networks.
- Train the models on Google's Colab Jupyter Notebooks, using their backend computations.
